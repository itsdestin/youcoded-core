# Changelog

All notable changes to ClaudifestDestiny will be documented in this file.

## v1.0.1 (2026-03-16)

### Fixes
- Fixed plugin registration — uses symlinks into `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/commands/`, `~/.claude/hooks/` instead of broken `enabledPlugins` path entries
- Fixed statusline not working after install — now uses `statusLine` config in `settings.json` instead of hook registration
- Bootstrap installer verifies symlinks on Mac, falls back to copy if broken

### New Features
- `/toolkit` command — full reference card with all features, trigger phrases, and available-but-not-installed modules
- Periodic `/toolkit` reminder every ~20 sessions via session-start hook
- Error guidance tips (`★ Tip` blocks) — reassures non-technical users that Claude can fix errors on its own
- gcloud CLI as optional core dependency for direct Google API authorization
- Homebrew installed by default on Mac before all other dependencies

### Improvements
- Every auth step (gcloud, gh, rclone, Todoist) rewritten as beginner-friendly step-by-step walkthroughs
- gh CLI upgraded from optional to strongly recommended (needed for updates and config backup)
- MCP server config (Phase 5 Step 6) now has concrete JSON templates for todoist and gmessages
- Setup completion now shows `/toolkit` reference card instead of contribute prompts
- Removed contribute pressure from setup flow — no more asking new users to contribute upstream
- DRIVE_ROOT prompt explains what "root folder" means in plain language
- rclone setup uses direct `config create` command with interactive fallback (type #24 hint)
