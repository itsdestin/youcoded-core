# Stop hook — remind Claude to verify system change checklist

#
# PID assumption: Both git-sync.sh and this hook use $PPID to identify the
# Claude Code process. This works because Claude Code spawns hook subprocesses
# as direct children. If PIDs don't match in practice, fall back to
# timestamp-based filtering (entries within last 12 hours).
#
# Advisory only: Stop hooks cannot block — this is a best-effort reminder.
# The CLAUDE.md hard gate and system.md checklist are the primary enforcement.
