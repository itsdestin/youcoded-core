# Google Drive via rclone

Always use `rclone` with the `gdrive:` remote for all Google Drive operations. Never attempt to use browser automation, MCP tools, or the Drive web UI.

## Remote name

The configured remote is `gdrive:` (work Google account — DeMenna). Always prefix paths with `gdrive:`. For personal Google Drive (tjmorin03@gmail.com), use `gdrive-personal:` directly — do NOT use this skill.

Examples:
- Root of Drive → `gdrive:`
- A folder → `gdrive:Claude`
- A nested path → `gdrive:Projects/Work/report.pdf`

## Common Commands

### List files and folders
```bash
rclone ls gdrive:                        # list all files recursively (with sizes)
rclone lsd gdrive:                       # list directories only (top level)
rclone lsd gdrive:FolderName             # list subdirectories inside a folder
rclone lsf gdrive:                       # flat list, good for scripts
rclone lsf gdrive:FolderName --dirs-only # only folders
```

### Create a folder
```bash
rclone mkdir gdrive:FolderName
rclone mkdir "gdrive:Parent/Child"
```

### Upload (local → Drive)
```bash
rclone copy /local/file.txt gdrive:TargetFolder/
rclone copy /local/folder/ gdrive:TargetFolder/ --progress
```

### Download (Drive → local)
```bash
rclone copy gdrive:FolderName/file.txt /local/destination/
rclone copy gdrive:FolderName/ /local/destination/ --progress
```

### Move / Rename
```bash
rclone moveto gdrive:OldName/file.txt gdrive:NewName/file.txt
rclone move gdrive:SourceFolder/ gdrive:DestFolder/
```

### Delete
```bash
rclone deletefile gdrive:FolderName/file.txt   # delete a single file
rclone purge gdrive:FolderName                 # delete folder and all contents
```

### Sync (mirror local → Drive, deletions included)
```bash
rclone sync /local/folder/ gdrive:TargetFolder/ --progress
```

### Check / diff
```bash
rclone check /local/folder/ gdrive:RemoteFolder/
```

### Search for a file by name
```bash
rclone lsf gdrive: --include "filename.ext"
```

## Tips

- Use `--dry-run` before any destructive operation (`move`, `sync`, `purge`) to preview what will happen.
- Use `--progress` for large transfers to show live progress.
- Paths with spaces must be quoted: `"gdrive:My Folder/file.txt"`
- `rclone ls` lists files recursively; `rclone lsf` is better for scripting.
- To check the remote is working: `rclone lsd gdrive:` — if it returns without error, auth is fine.
